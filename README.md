# Wordle

This is a fun project which i decided to do to check how the Wordle app could be implemented.

User can use onscreen keyboard and physical keyboard to type its guesses.
After the game is over user can restart the game.

## How to run it

clone the app and use commands:

install dependencies

`npm install` or `yarn install`

start the app

`npm start` or `yarn start`

run the test

`npm test` or `yarn test`

run test coverage

`npm run test:coverage` or `yarn run test:coverage`
